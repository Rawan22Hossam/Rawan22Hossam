## Experience

### Software Developer | Dsquares — June 2024 – Present
- Architected backend services using **MediatR** and **CQRS** to decouple business logic from controllers, improving maintainability and enabling independent scaling of read/write paths.
- Built high-throughput messaging microservices for SMS, Email and Push using **Apache Kafka** (with Conduktor) and **Redis** for caching and deduplication, enabling reliable event-driven workflows across services.
- Designed and deployed the AnaAlahly App backend using **Python** on **AWS** (Lambda, API Gateway, S3); integrated **Cloudflare** for edge caching, rate limiting and DDoS protection.
- Led API Contract design with **OpenAPI/Swagger** to ensure consistent integrations across squads and external partners.
- Automated documentation migration and operational tasks via **n8n** (saving ~$1,200/year) and acted as Product Owner Proxy managing JIRA roadmaps and requirements.
- Improved CI/CD delivery using **AWS CodePipeline** and **Bitbucket Pipelines**; enforced quality with unit tests (**XUnit**, **Pytest**) and full-cycle API testing.

### Coding Instructor | Ischool — Feb 2024 – Nov 2024
- Mentored 50+ students (ages 6–18) in Web Dev (HTML/CSS), Game Dev (**Godot**) and Mobile Dev (**Flutter**); created age-appropriate, hands-on projects and UI/UX workshops.

### Software Developer Intern | Dsquares — July 2023 – Sept 2023
- Implemented RESTful APIs using **ASP.NET Core** and **Entity Framework Core**; optimized SQL Server queries for improved response times.
